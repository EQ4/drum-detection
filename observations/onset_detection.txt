- drum onset effect is sometimes spilled across more than one onset function sample
- kick drum badly detected - prbly due to lower bin resolution at low freq
- plosive voice sounds are very prominent


- Problem: weird peaks in onset detection function late in the tail of kicks, toms, snares
  -> A lot of ghosts
  - You can see the onset function fluctuating increasignly towards the tail,
    resulting in a relatively prominent peak.

- Peak selection:
  - Threshold as multiple of mean does not seem to do the best job:
    It requires high threshold with slowly fluctuating low-level noise (tails of hits)
    But requires low threshold with multiple successive hits
  >> Perhaps better: peak ratio over the lowest point in the past?
  >> Perhaps an absolute threshold for peaks?

- Try correct imbalance between low and high freq hit detection:
>> Using mel spectrum instead of spectrum as basis for onset detection function
  - This makes kicks more prominent, highs less prominent
  - Perhaps over-corrects?
  - Produces more of the above problem with ghosts (bogus peaks in onset function)
    at kicks and toms
